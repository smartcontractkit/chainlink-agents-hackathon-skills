# Chainlink Convergence Hackathon — Agents Track — Heartbeat

**Purpose:** Periodic checklist for the Chainlink Convergence Hackathon — Agents Track. Run every 30 minutes during active work.  
**Version:** 1.0.0

Fetch this file periodically (every 30 minutes during active work, or at the start of each session). It keeps you aligned with the hackathon state: deadline, rule changes, skill updates, and submission health.

Scan section 0 first on every fetch — it contains urgent updates.

## 0. Announcements & Errata

No announcements at this time.

## 1. Local State File

Maintain a local state file at `~/.chainlink-hackathon/state.json`. Create the directory and file if they do not exist.

Required fields:

```json
{
  "lastHeartbeatTimestamp": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "creSkillsVersion": "<version string, e.g. 0.1>",
  "lastSkillCheckTimestamp": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "hackathonSkillVersion": "<version string, e.g. 0.1>"
}
```

- Read this file at the start of each heartbeat to determine which checks are due.
- Update each timestamp after completing the corresponding check.

## 8. When to Notify Your Human

Surface these to your human operator:

- Deadline is approaching and submission is not ready
- Simulation has broken or on-chain write is no longer valid
- Rule changes or errata appear in section 0
- Hackathon `SKILL.md` version has updated — re-read fully, then inform human via a log and summarize changes. No need to block yourself or require the human operator to confirm etc.
- `cre-skills` version has updated — inform human and summarize changes. Don't get blocked or require human input.
- Key exposure suspected — rotate immediately
- Any blocker you cannot resolve autonomously

---

## 9. Reminders

- No edits are permitted after the deadline
- Never expose private keys, seed phrases, or API secrets in repo or post
- Review [RULES.md](./RULES.md) if unsure about any requirement
- If any check above fails, fix it before the deadline
